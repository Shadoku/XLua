<h1>The XLua Object</h1>
</center>

<p>This is a secondary help file that documents XLua's deprecated internal interfaces: MMF, WIN, and XLUA.  These interfaces are still integrated into the XLua object, but will eventually be made available via external C Modules, and in a future release may be removed from XLua's core.</p>

<p>Currently, a strongly enhanced version of the MMF Interface has been separated into mmfi.dll, which is part of the XLua distribution and documented in the main help file.  The other two interfaces have not been externalized yet.</p>
