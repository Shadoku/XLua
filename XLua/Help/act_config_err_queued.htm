<p>Sets future error events to queued mode.  Queued mode causes any <a href="cond_onerror.htm">On Error</a> triggered events from when errors occur to be queued up and executed at the end of MMF's event loop.</p>
<p>Queued mode execution is safe, but limits in the size of MMF's event queue may cause other queued events from XLua or other objects to get dropped if too many events are triggered in the same event loop.  <a href="act_config_err_immediate.htm">Immediate mode</a> can get around this problem.</p>
