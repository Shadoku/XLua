<p>This is a hybrid condition/action that sets the internal selected object list from a table of fixed values.  This should typically be the only selecting condition in the event, although you may further refine the selection by adding other selecting conditions below it.  This condition would typically be paired with an XLua <a href="cond_onfunc.htm">On Function</a> condition.</p>
